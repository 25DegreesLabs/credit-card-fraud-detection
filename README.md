# Fraud Detection Project

## What I Built
A machine learning model that detects credit card fraud. Analyzed 568K transactions and found the key patterns fraudsters leave behind.

## Why I Did This
I've been working with automation and AI tools in freelance projects, and I got curious about applying this to financial crime. So I built this to learn how fraud detection actually works.

## Main Discovery
Out of 29 possible features, just 4 (V10, V14, V12, V4) do most of the heavy lifting in catching fraud. That's a game changer for investigation teams.

## Tech Used
Python, pandas, scikit-learn. Built with LLM assistance to help me learn as I went.

## What I Learned
How to process large datasets, build ML models, and most importantly, how to explain technical findings in plain English that businesses can actually use.

## Files
* Full analysis notebook
* Easy-view HTML version
* PDF summary

This was my deep dive into understanding fraud detection from a technical perspective. It bridges my automation background with my interest in financial crime prevention.
